## Basic Questions

#### What should I write about?

It's important that you write about something you are passionate about, and feel that others should learn more about. However you need to keep in mind that post performance is evaluated based on the 5 star quality readers rate your articlees, plus how many people share your article on social media - including twitter, linkedin, google plus and facebook.
In our experience, articles that do well are

- well written 
- accurate 
- concise 
- specific and opinionated 
- useful 
- sometimes controversial 
- cover specific experiences rather than general ones 

If you aren't a native English speaker, consider getting your article proof read before submitting.
Articles that don't receive much attention tend to be

- Badly written 
- Inaccurate 
- Too vague and not focused on a specific problem 
- Too basic / Too general 
- Contain nothing new
