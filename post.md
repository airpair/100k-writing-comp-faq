## Basic Questions

#### What should I write about?

It's important that you write about something you are passionate about, and feel that others should learn more about. However you need to keep in mind that post performance is evaluated based on the quality of your post, along with how many people share it on social media - including twitter, linkedin, google plus and facebook.

In our experience, posts that do well are:

- well written 
- accurate 
- concise 
- specific and opinionated 
- useful 
- sometimes controversial 
- covering specific experiences rather than general ones 

*If you aren't a native English speaker, consider getting your post proof read before submitting.*

Posts that don't receive much attention tend to be:

- Badly written 
- Inaccurate 
- Too vague and not focused on a specific problem 
- Too basic / Too general 
- Containing nothing new
